<h2><a name="_alloc"></a>CONTROL ALLOCATION</h2>

    The <b>control allocation problem</b> is that of distributing a
    desired total control effort among a redundant set of actuators.
    In flight control, for example, the total control effort
    corresponds to the aerodynamic moments (and sometimes also forces)
    to be produced, and the actuators are the control surfaces
    available on the aircraft.

<h2><a name="_notation"></a>NOTATION AND TERMINOLOGY</h2>
    
    We will refer to the total control effort as the <b>virtual
    control input</b>, v(t), while the actuator positions constitute
    the <b>true control input</b>, u(t). The total control effort
    produced by the actuators is decided by the <b>control
    effectiveness matrix</b>, B:
    <p>
    <div class="box"><center><b>v(t) = B u(t)</b></center></div>
    <p>
      Here, dim(v) = k, dim(u) = m, and B is a (k x m)-matrix.

    <p>
      Each actuator is assumed to be physically limited by upper and
      lower <b>position and rate limits</b>. Using a digital
      controller, the rate constraint can be viewed as a time-varying
      position constraint ("how far can the actuator move during the
      next sampling interval?"). This gives the following overall box
      constraint:
    </p>

    <p>
    <div class="box"><center><b>umin(t) &lt;= u(t) &lt;=
	  umax(t)</b></center></div></p>
    
    <p>
      Combining the equations, we see that different commanded values
      of v(t) lead to different cases - there can either be an
      infinite set of solutions u(t), one unique solution, or no
      feasible solution at all.
    </p>

<h2><a name="_qp"></a>QP FORMULATION</h2>
    
    In the quadratic programming approach to control allocation, also
    known as <b>l2-optimal control allocation</b>, the control
    allocation problem is posed as the following sequential
    least-squares (sls) problem:
    <p>
    <div class="box"><center>
	<b>min ||Wu(u-ud)||</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp subj. to&nbsp&nbsp u in M <p>
	  
	  <b>M = arg min ||Wv(Bu-v)||</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp subj. to
	  &nbsp&nbsp umin &lt;= u &lt;= umax
      </center></div>
    <p>
      
      This optimization problem should be interpreted as follows:
      Given M, the set of feasible control inputs that minimize Bu-v
      (weighted by Wv), pick the control input that minimizes u-ud
      (weighted by Wu).
    <p>
      Above, ud is the <b>desired control input</b> (typically zero)
      and Wu and Wv are <b>weighting matrices</b>. Wu affects the
      control distribution among the actuators and Wv affects the
      prioritization among the virtual control components when Bu=v
      cannot be attained due to the actuator constraints.
    <p>
      The problem can be reformulated as a weighted least-squares (wls)
      problem:
    <p>
    <div class="box"><center>
	<b>min ||Wu(u-ud)||^2 + gamma
	  ||Wv(Bu-v)||^2</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp subj. to &nbsp&nbsp
	umin &lt;= u &lt;= umax 
      </center></div>
    <p>
      As gamma goes to infinity, the two formulations have the same
      optimal solution, u(t).

<h2><a name="_overview"></a>TOOLBOX OVERVIEW</h2>

    The toolbox functions are grouped into different categories:

    <dl>
      <dt><b>QP allocation</b></dt>
      <dd>Contains the <b>core functions</b> of the toolbox - Matlab
	implementations of the five solvers listed above. These
	functions solve the allocation problem for a single virtual
	control input v, given B, umin, umax, and (optionally) the
	tuning variables Wv, Wu and ud.
	<p>
	  These functions have been implemented as efficiently as
	  possible (to the author's ability).

      <dt><b>Direct allocation</b></dt>
      <dd>For comparison, a simple algorithm for direct allocation has
      also been implemented (not optimized for speed). The solver is
      based on the LP formulation presented in<p> <font	color="#006699">
	    M. Bodson.
      Evaluation of optimization methods for control allocation.
      Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, 25(4):703-711,
      2002.</dd></font>
	  
      <dt><b>Dynamic allocation</b></dt>
      <dd>In dynamic control allocation, a term that penalizes the
	actuator rates is added to the objective function. The
	resulting <b>frequency dependent control distribution</b> can be
	computed using the dca command. See also<p><font color="#006699">
	  O. Härkegård. Dynamic control allocation using constrained
	  quadratic programming. In AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and
	  Control Conf., 2002.  </dd></font>

      <dt><b>Simulation</b></dt>
      <dd>These functions simulate the time response of different
      types of allocators to arbitrary inputs (much like the standard
      LSIM command). They also output the <b>computation time</b> per
      sample for the selected solver, averaged over a number of
      repetitions set by the user. The qcatlib <b>Simulink</b> library
      contains blocks for QP and dynamic control allocation. <p> 

      <dt><b>Linear control</b></dt>
      <dd>Features two conversion functions for extracting the control
	allocation part of a given <b>LQ controller</b>, and for merging an
	allocator with an LQ controller, respectively. See <p><font color="#006699">
	  O. Härkegård. Resolving actuator redundancy - control
	  allocation vs. linear quadratic control. In European Control
	  Conf., 2003.<p></font>
	  
	  The vview function allows the user to evaluate the gain of
	  using constrained control allocation rather than a linear
	  allocation control law (as in LQ, for example). This is done
	  by visualizing the <b>feasible virtual control set</b>.

    In both cases, the components of the virtual control v are the
    aerodynamic moment coefficients Cl, Cm, and Cn.
