## About
This is a repos. for test new control allocation algorithm developed from [ simulation of the book "aircraft control allocation"](https://github.com/mengchaoheng/aircraft-control-allocation) and [qcat](https://github.com/mengchaoheng/qcat).

The new algorithm will used by a ductedfan UAV.

1. the lib. of qcat and aircraft-control-allocation-book-simulation is used as submodules here.

2. the ac.slx and some files from the compare of allocation in Plan-D (`alloc_compa`).


3. test.m, constraint.m and twin.slx come from `allocation m2C`，view the attainable set。

4. some new algorithm is show here.
